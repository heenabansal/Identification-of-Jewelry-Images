Jewellary Images Classification Model -  Used a ResNet50 model to classify different types of jewellary images. The google images downloaded had three types of jewellary images, 1000 images each of necklaces, bracelets and earnings. Used State of the Art FastAI library for training the model using differential learning rates for different groups of layers and Stochastic Gradient Descent with Restarts. Achieved an accuracy of 98.9%.
